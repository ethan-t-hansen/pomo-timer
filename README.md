# CPSC 210 Project - Pomodoro Timer
___

**Name:** Ethan Hansen \
**Student ID:** 16566192

### Proposal:
___

The proposed application is a pomodoro timer to help students focus on their work while staying on task. 

The target audience for my application will be university students who struggle with productivity during study sessions.

The project is of particular interest to me because I myself am a student who can't consistently focus while studying.
Although online pomodoro timers for studying exist out there, I have yet to try one that I enjoy using. Thus, I aim to
develop such an application for my CPSC 210 project.




### User Stories:
___

- As a user, I want to be able to *start*, *pause*, and *reset* my timers
- As a user, I want to be able to *add* and *remove* task items in the list. I also want to be able to *clear* my list.
- As a user, I want to be able to "complete" tasks and *move* them to a separate list
- As a user, I want to be able to customize the duration of my timer
- As a user, I want to be able to *switch* between study, short break, and long break timer views
- As a user, I want to be able to *save my current tasks* to a file and *load them later*
- As a user, I want to be able to *save my the tasks I've completed in this session* to a file and *load them later*
- As a user, I want to be able to *save total time studying* to a file and *view previous session times*

### Phase 4: Task 2
___

Nothing is logged when the application first starts. This is because the user needs to do an action in order for any events
to be logged.


### Phase 4: Task 3
___
I think that the PomoFrame class is way too bulky and definitely could be split off into multiple classes to improve readability

Besides this, nothing in particular stands off as improvable when looking at the UML diagram holistically. However, if I had the time,
I would prefer to design my own Timer class that could override some implementations of the Java library.
