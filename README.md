# CPSC 210 Project - Pomodoro Timer
___

**Name:** Ethan Hansen \
**Student ID:** 16566192

### Proposal:
___

The proposed application is a pomodoro timer to help students focus on their work while staying on task. 

The target audience for my application will be university students who struggle with productivity during study sessions.

The project is of particular interest to me because I myself am a student who can't consistently focus while studying.
Although online pomodoro timers for studying exist out there, I have yet to try one that I enjoy using. Thus, I aim to
develop such an application for my CPSC 210 project.
